# Fitness Online Backend - Spring Boot REST API

Welcome to the core of the **Fitness Online Platform** - a Spring Boot REST API that's doing a lot of the hard work for you (unless you're following one of our workout programs, then, well... you're on your own there).

## üèãÔ∏è What's this all about?

This is the backend for an online fitness platform where users can:
- **Browse, filter, and join** fitness programs (whether you're into yoga or prefer something more intense like HIIT).
- Keep a **workout journal** to track your progress, whether you're making big gains or just getting started.
- Get **daily exercise suggestions** from an API that knows exactly what you need to stay fit (okay, not exactly, but it's close).
- Manage your profile, make payments, and so much more!

## üí° Key Features

1. **Manage Fitness Programs**: 
   - Browse programs by category (cardio, strength, flexibility, HIIT) and check all the details like name, description, and location (online or at your local gym/park). 
   - Programs are displayed with key info like the name, picture, and price, with pagination to avoid endless scrolling.

2. **Track Your Activity**: 
   - Log your workouts, including how long they were, how hard you worked, and what results you got.
   - View your progress through nice charts, because let's be honest, graphs make everything better.

3. **Daily Exercise Recommendations**: 
   - Get daily exercise suggestions based on what you like. 
   - This keeps your workouts fresh and your muscles guessing!

4. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - Register securely with email verification, because I take security seriously (but not *too* seriously).
   - Forgot your password? Don't worry - I've got you (except maybe on leg day).

5. **RESTful Services**:
   - Every feature is available through clean RESTful endpoints, making frontend integration a breeze. Manage profiles, browse programs, log your activities - it's all up to you.

6. **Payments**:
   - You can pay for programs using a card, PayPal, or even in person. While this is just the basic payment flow, it sets up the possibility for more detailed payment options later.

7. **Admin Features**:
   - If you're an admin, you've got control over categories, users, and even logs. It's all neatly available through the admin panel.

8. **Messaging and Notifications**:
   - Send messages to fitness advisors if you need help picking a program.
   - You can subscribe to certain categories and get emails about new programs that match what you're looking for.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Fast, reliable, and gets the job done.
- **JPA/Hibernate**: For handling the database, making it nice and smooth.
- **MySQL**: Yup, this is where the app stores everything  -  programs, users, logs, and all the other important stuff.
- **JWT Security**: For secure authentication, keeping everything safe.
- **External API Integrations**: Get daily exercise suggestions thanks to API Ninjas.

## üìà Bonus Features
- You can download your workout history as a PDF (for when you want to show off your fitness progress).
- If you're into fitness and coding, this app will give you gains in both areas!

I hope this app helps you in your fitness journey! Feel free to check out the code, fork it, and customize it to your liking... And don't be too harsh as it's my first ever written SpringBoot project! 

Stay fit, stay RESTful! üòé
